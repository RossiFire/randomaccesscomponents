## Philosophy
This idea of this project is to deliver minimal but powerful components.
That's not a brainless copy-paste "wow" components. Think of it as a shadcn/ui with steroids. 
You're going to write some code of course, but you'll have already a solid, accessible and animated structure ready to be customized based on your needs.

- All the components are built using less dependencies as possible, without bloating the bundle size and your package.json. This also gives you more flexibility over the component.
- Almost all the components are built using Tailwind CSS, to give you more flexibility over the styling.
- TypeScript, not JavaScript. This gives you type safety and better readability.
- Accessibility: Every component is built with accessibility in mind, to be compliant.


## Guidelines
This project is built in the ecosystem of NextJs, but most of the components can be used with React as well.
For issues, check the [Common Issues](/docs/getting-started/common-issues) page.


## Configuration
In order to use the code without generating errors, you need a bit of base configuration.

### Tailwind CSS
Most of the components use Tailwind CSS for styling, so you can follow the official [Tailwind CSS guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/nextjs) to install it.
Additionally, install the following dependencies:

<PkgInstallerTabs command="clsx tailwind-merge" />

Then copy and paste the following code into your project.

```typescript title="lib/utils.ts" icon="typescript"
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"
 
export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```

### Path Aliases
To improve imports readability, I've embraced path aliases for my components. If you want too, add the following lines into the tsconfig.json.
```json title="tsconfig.json" icon="json"
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["./*"],
  "@/lib/*": ["./lib/*"],
  "@/hooks/*": ["./hooks/*"],
  "@/components/*": ["./components/*"],
},
```

And you're done! That's really it. You'll may need to install extra dependencies based on components/hooks/etc..., but now you're ready. Happy coding!
