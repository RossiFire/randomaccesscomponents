Hey stressed dev, how's going on?

I really appreciate if you would give a star to the project on [Github](https://github.com/RossiFire/randomaccesscomponents). It's free and it helps me a lot.

Instead if you want to contribute you can fork the project and create a pull request from the [Github](https://github.com/RossiFire/randomaccesscomponents) page.
If you really appreciate my work, you can also buy me a coffee at [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/dnadaniele). Thank you!
